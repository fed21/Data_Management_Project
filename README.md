# Data_Management_Project
The goal is to take a NoSQL database, Neo4j,  showing a relevant usage of them over the selected dataset.
The idea is to use Neo4j in two tasks:
1. The first task related to a dataset of transfermarkt.com and, using the graph as a data model, to represent the transfers that took place in a certain year or with particular properties; then it is about to show queries that can be advantageous in a representation of this type.
2. The second task is instead to show how a graph can be exploited in match analysis: this consists in taking a dataset from statsbomb.com relating to the events of a single match and showing how the graph can be structured and then some useful queries.
